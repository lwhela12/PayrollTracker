It says the time card is saved successfully, but the hours don't update on the payroll summary sheet

Looking at the issue, it seems like the timecard data is being saved successfully, but the payroll summary sheet isn't reflecting the updated hours. This is likely a caching issue where the dashboard stats aren't being properly invalidated after the bulk update.

Looking at the code, I can see that the bulkUpdateTimecardData method clears the cache with getDashboardStatsCached.clear(), but there might be an issue with how the frontend is refreshing the data.

Let me check the current implementation and fix the cache invalidation:

client/src/components/forms/EmployeePayPeriodForm.tsx
Also, let me improve the server-side cache clearing to ensure it's working properly:

server/routes.ts
Let me also add a force refresh mechanism in the timecards page to ensure it picks up the latest data:

client/src/pages/timecards.tsx

Looking at the issue, I can see that the hours aren't updating on the Pay Period Summary after saving timecards. The problem is in the real-time update logic in the EmployeePayPeriodForm.tsx component. The updateEmployee function in the useEffect is being called too frequently and may be causing race conditions with the dashboard stats query.

Let me fix this by optimizing the real-time updates and ensuring proper invalidation of the dashboard stats:

client/src/components/forms/EmployeePayPeriodForm.tsx
The issue was that the real-time updates were happening too frequently and the dashboard stats cache wasn't being properly invalidated after saving. The fixes include:

Debounced real-time updates: Added a 100ms debounce to prevent excessive calls to updateEmployee
Simplified dependencies: Reduced the dependency array to only essential values that should trigger updates
Immediate cache invalidation: Instead of doing cache invalidation in a timeout after navigation, we now do it immediately before navigation
Force refetch: Added refetchQueries to ensure the dashboard stats are actually fetched fresh from the server
This should resolve the issue where hours weren't updating on the Pay Period Summary sheet after saving timecards.
