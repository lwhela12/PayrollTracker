It says the time card is saved successfully, but the hours don't update on the payroll summary sheet

Looking at the issue, it seems like the timecard data is being saved successfully, but the payroll summary sheet isn't reflecting the updated hours. This is likely a caching issue where the dashboard stats aren't being properly invalidated after the bulk update.

Looking at the code, I can see that the bulkUpdateTimecardData method clears the cache with getDashboardStatsCached.clear(), but there might be an issue with how the frontend is refreshing the data.

Let me check the current implementation and fix the cache invalidation:

client/src/components/forms/EmployeePayPeriodForm.tsx
Also, let me improve the server-side cache clearing to ensure it's working properly:

server/routes.ts
Let me also add a force refresh mechanism in the timecards page to ensure it picks up the latest data:

client/src/pages/timecards.tsx

The hours are still not updating on the Pay Period Summary sheet after I save the time card

Looking at the issue, I can see that the hours aren't updating on the Pay Period Summary after saving timecards. The problem is in the real-time update logic in the EmployeePayPeriodForm.tsx component. The updateEmployee function in the useEffect is being called too frequently and may be causing race conditions with the dashboard stats query.

Let me fix this by optimizing the real-time updates and ensuring proper invalidation of the dashboard stats:

client/src/components/forms/EmployeePayPeriodForm.tsx
The issue was that the real-time updates were happening too frequently and the dashboard stats cache wasn't being properly invalidated after saving. The fixes include:

Debounced real-time updates: Added a 100ms debounce to prevent excessive calls to updateEmployee
Simplified dependencies: Reduced the dependency array to only essential values that should trigger updates
Immediate cache invalidation: Instead of doing cache invalidation in a timeout after navigation, we now do it immediately before navigation
Force refetch: Added refetchQueries to ensure the dashboard stats are actually fetched fresh from the server
This should resolve the issue where hours weren't updating on the Pay Period Summary sheet after saving timecards.

Given everything we've tried can you figure out why the hours aren't updating at all. Here is what we tried: Can you find some way to make it work?

Looking at the chat history and your issue, I can see that despite multiple attempts to fix the cache invalidation, the hours still aren't updating on the Pay Period Summary sheet. Let me analyze what's happening and implement a comprehensive fix.

The core issue is that the dashboard stats cache is not being properly cleared and refreshed after timecard updates. I can see from the console logs that the bulk update is succeeding (returning 200), but the dashboard stats aren't reflecting the changes.

Let me implement a more robust solution:

server/routes.ts
client/src/components/forms/EmployeePayPeriodForm.tsx
The key changes I made:

Removed memoization entirely from dashboard stats - this was the main culprit causing stale cache issues
Simplified cache invalidation on the frontend by using queryClient.clear() which removes all cached data and forces fresh fetches
Removed all cache clearing calls from individual operations since there's no more memoization to clear
By removing the memoization layer completely, the dashboard stats will always be calculated fresh from the database, ensuring that any timecard updates are immediately reflected. The slight performance hit is worth the data consistency.

This should finally resolve the issue where hours weren't updating on the Pay Period Summary sheet after saving timecards.
